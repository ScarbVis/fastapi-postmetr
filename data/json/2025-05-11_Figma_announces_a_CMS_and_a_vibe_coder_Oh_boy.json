        "text": "Hello Theo!\nDid Shopify kill designers? Not at all. No AI will ever be able to do that either. Why? Because designers use multiple tools to make a website look unique, whether it's pictures, videos, or whatever else.\n\nOf course, we‚Äôll lose all the \"all-knowing,\" egoistic clients (which has been our dream for decades), because sooner or later, those pricks will still hire a junior designer who agrees to their shitty rates.\n\nWhen it comes to tools like Framer or Webflow, we‚Äôll always design websites and products in Figma. Remember Sketch, Adobe XD, Photoshop? Figma dominates not just because it holds the entire design system, but because it‚Äôs hands down the fastest way to design a full website, product, or whatever you‚Äôre building, from start to finish. We use it to create final, high-fidelity designs, not just rough ideas. Once that‚Äôs done, we either paste them into Framer or hand off the Figma file to a developer. (And Figma will eventually cut out that last step: the devs.)\n\nSo honestly, you‚Äôve got it completely backwards. It‚Äôs actually front-end and even some back-end developers who are at risk.\nDesigners, like myself, are increasingly using AI to implement JavaScript libraries, React components, and more without relying on devs.\n\nThe only developers who‚Äôll remain essential are those working on complex systems like dashboards, infrastructure, or deep backend logic.\nBut even that might be temporary. In the end, we‚Äôll reach a point where designers become hybrid creators, vibe coders, doing it all.\n\nCode is a math language. It‚Äôs all documentation, easily stored and trained. Design, on the other hand, is art.\nSure, AI can generate photorealistic stock images or flashy ads, but you‚Äôre assuming that even semi-serious design studios will just whisper to AI, ‚ÄúHey, make me a sexy e-commerce site for my gym with hot, realistic photos.‚Äù\n\nBut there will always be pixels or layout quirks that trigger your OCD. Tons of little things that take a month to get just right.\nWhat I‚Äôm saying is, even if that day comes, design studios will still mostly hire designers to do the manual adjustments while using AI for the coding.",

          "text": "You redeemed yourself after the 10th minute :D\r\n\r\nBut also, your view that Figma is scared to evaporate designers is so stupid. Not because designers are the majority of their client base, but because designers will be needed as long as humans exist. And it‚Äôs not just designers who use Figma. The whole company uses it: content writers, marketing teams, UX, UI teams, even the janitors are part of Figma.\r\n\r\nYour basic argument is that Figma is scared to remove the brain of companies. No. They literally can‚Äôt live without the brain. There‚Äôs no professional product without it.\r\nYou sound like one of those ancient devs who thinks design was always easy to make and can be easily replaced by AI. \r\nEven if a company chooses to use AI images or illustrations, do you know how many design styles there are? The manual edits? Animations? Lottie, Rive? Designers do those.\r\n\r\nThe devs I used to work with 10 years ago, some lazy pricks, of course they‚Äôd be happy with mobile-designed desktop websites and AI-generated stock images.\r\nBut it was the designers who innovated all the crazy shit they‚Äôve been complaining about for years. Designers forced them to expand their skills.\r\nOtherwise, if they were in charge, they‚Äôd finish a Word-page-like website in 3 days, grab the money, and not give a fvck.\r\n\r\nDevs were always there to serve us, and AI tools will do the same.\r\n\r\nNo serious small company will accept a basic premade template that AI duplicates and modifies for them, even if it looks gorgeous.\r\nCompanies want to stand out and look unique. It‚Äôs the same reason why people don‚Äôt buy bulk-made t-shirts from China. \r\nEveryone wants their own custom style, built around their brand guidelines.",

        "text": "I think it comes down to how much attention you want in the experience. If you just want screens that flow together and generally work okay, then go with AI. To fine-tune the experience, the skills of a designer will be needed. In some ways, an analogy could be cars: if all you want is a cheap car, you can get one that is mass-produced for a low cost. But if you want something more custom or, in the context of cars, luxurious, you have to go with a premium hand-built model (e.g., Ferrari, Rolls-Royce, etc.). AAD (AI Assisted Design) will bring the concept of mass production to digital design by creating an automated but lower-end final result. This may be good enough for many businesses and goals. But there will likely always be a need for human designers to make the best digital experiences.",

Their headers are not even headers, they are spans inside div, inside div, inside div, inside div. Their hover effects done with JS, not CSS. And all their animations are in JS. If they will keep it like that, this will give birth to tons of really bad sites on the internets. I hope it's just an \"alpha pre-build visualization of what's comming\". If not, then I don't think Figma will even survive with this low-quality product. Maybe it's their last effort to get some money from designers while this profession is still relevant, I dunno.",

Sure, you can quickly prompt a UI, but many design decisions are driven by factors such as taste, business needs, user input, a desire for joy and expressivity that I think will be hard to replicate. There's too much human input in design. On the other hand, development is a much more logic-driven action, where to achieve X you need to do Y and Z. \n\nI think what will happen is that those who want the easiest cheapest route will take the AI route (small companies or quick projects) but those who truly want to create products that have an impact and that have a meaning will still rely on PDs.",

The problem is that there is two types of designers graphical designers and multimedia designers. If you cannot be bothered to learn something as fundamental as CSS in webdesign, you shouldnt be anywhere near the drawingboard - Working with graphic designers on multimedia especially the web is annoying, they dont know how even shadows or borders work, they never consider the multitude of screen formats, they are not cut out for the job, get a multimedia designer - They are even taught HTML and CSS along with the relevant design principles.",

Why vendor lock yourself to Figma instead of getting a designer that knows the canvas they are working on? That seems more efficient timewise and monetary to me.",

Maybe more people want a simple website than a full-stack app, but it's always (for several years, anyway) been fairly easy for an inexperienced person to build a simple site with these tools than to build a product, so now all those people who did want full products and couldn't afford a coder can actually build them. I'm one of those people. I only built simple websites and blogs before because I had no way to build anything complex, but love building things.",

        "text": "Figma has owned Designers for years now and bested many competitors to get there. And, while I agree that AI looms large over both Designers and Developers, what is really happening here is the rise of Webflow and its own competitors of Designer-centric low-code page builders. For years, the Agency go-to has been Figma + Webflow. But, as Webflow and its like have improved by leaps and bounds, Designers have started to cut Figma out entirely. Designing directly in Webflow's aptly named Designer interface. This is super compelling to Designers, especially since Webflow also has a mature CMS that is not as easy/cheap or ubiquitous as Wordpress but offers the flexibility for the end-customer you describe. So Figma has woken up to the threat and come to realize that if the web builders are going to walk away with the Designers, Figma has to start treating Webflow as a rival and match their page building capabilities. IMO Webflow should acquire them or vice versa. Webflow is a much more acquisitive company. I built a utility library that helps Developers get around some of the constraints inherent to Webflow's Designer-centric bias which used to be part of the no-code now low-code. Indeed the future is a great design to publish tool to design pixel perfect front ends with the full prowess or a professional dev stack, which is the bridge my library solves for. The point is, Figma no longer has a lock on Designers so if the want to survive they must take on the likes of Webflow. The problem is they are starting very late and that's without the very valid points you've made about AI.",

        "text": "I don‚Äôt think they threaten anyone. Most web designers today know how to code and design in Figma, maybe not for complex tasks, but definitely for most client-requested changes. If they can‚Äôt do it, they‚Äôll often turn to AI before going to a developer. That‚Äôs exactly what Figma did, like you mentioned at 10:00. Designers are generally cheaper than developers and often charge less per hour. I think you‚Äôre underestimating designers.\n\nFigma Make doesn‚Äôt turn designers into developers. It produces packages designed for Figma sites, not other projects. So while I can‚Äôt just drop Figma Make into a different project, I might be able to use Claude or Cursor to have AI convert it to something more compatible. Figma isn‚Äôt trying to scare developers away. They are trying to help designers feel less intimidated by code. So Lovable is still best for those who want a prompt-developed app.\n\nI recommend watching the ‚ÄúConfig 2025: From Prompt to Code with Figma Make and Sites‚Äù video on their playlist. Also, check out Figma MCP tools for Cursor. They help designers turn their Figma designs into code within VS Code to build screens. I think what would be really cool is designing in VS Code on a canvas like Figma, and there is a developer out there working on this so designers can design and code at the same time.\n\nA UX/UI designer‚Äôs job isn‚Äôt just to make things look good. It‚Äôs to make them usable through research and testing before development. This often saves time, and if you skip this step, your users become your testers, and those tests don‚Äôt always go well. This protects clients from themselves because the best business solution isn‚Äôt always the obvious one. Sometimes what sounds great on paper is bad for the user.\n\nFrom what you shared about your experience at Twitch, it sounds like you had bad UX designers who failed to advocate for user needs with the dev team. You mentioned you haven‚Äôt hired a designer in a while, but to me, that just means you became the UX designer, not that the role or the need went away.\n\nDesigners who think ‚Äúdesign is dead‚Äù are usually just designers who prefer to be told what to build. They think it‚Äôs all about making it look good and tricking the user into thinking it works well, instead of thinking strategically about the unique needs of their users.\n\nSorry if this comes off a bit much. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt plan to write all this, but I felt like maybe hearing from someone who works as a UX Designer, who also codes and actually loves doing it, might be worth something. I started following you because of your love for code and how much you care about users, and that‚Äôs something I really respect.",

        "text": "I think you miss a bit of context in terms of the hierarchy of visual coding tools like Framer and Webflow. They are probably more where the Figma team started seeing they need to move on this space. Sites and Make are definitely influenced by Lovable, Bolt and V0 etc as you say this year is when Figma seemed to wake up to but those tools are still kind of fun but mostly still fluff imo. \n\nAs a designer I definitely use V0 to formalise some of the more complex interactions since Figma is bad for prototyping but all the building apps struggle to properly recreate UI which naturally comes from Figma anyway. Adding the actual code these tools spit out into existing development environments is still rework. They are great ways to ideate and collaborate but ultimately all these tools are placeholders which you basically end up learning that it's probably better to just use Cursor where it has access to your actual codebase for projects of note and scale.\n\nI also think and you would know this well that Enterprise is where a lot of the chunkier problems to solve are for designers and developers alike with the added fun of these tools use-cases working through the layers of bureaucracy. \n\nAll that to say, just like Shopify, Fiver, Squarespace etc weren't the end of developers, these tools wont be the end of PMs, Designers, Developers etc where we have always been - at the end of the scale where you need to do more complex problems and use cases rather than the 10,000th landing page or dashboard widget or dare I say a chat wrapper interface ;)",

So bascially we are fine with lesser team. my guess is IT is a dead field u would not need this much engineer in this AI era. better to stick with medical or other field were field work is needed.  Even the number of clients that we had last year has become 1/2, competition has increase cause AI has literally f** the pricing and made an equal playing field for most companies , now a smaller company can also bid and execute task which was one time not possible due to lesser man & brain power.",
